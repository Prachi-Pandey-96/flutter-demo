Hello, I am vishakha.
I am learning flutter to develop mobile apps on android as well as ios.
Tools required to create mobile apps using flutter framework are:- Git,visual studio or android studio,Dart programming language etc.
Let's know something about 'Git'- Git is a version control system which record changes in source code during software development.
Visual studio is an IDE where we can run, modify,deploy and debug software.
